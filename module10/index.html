        <h1>Q:-Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks</h1>
        <h2>Ans:-</h2>
        <h3>Class Component Life Cycle:</h3>
        <p>Class components have several life cycle methods that are invoked at different stages of a component's
            existence. The typical life cycle of a class component includes the following phases:</p>
        <h5>1.Mounting Phase:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>constructor(): This method is called when an instance of the component is being created.</li>
            <li>render(): It examines this.props and this.state and returns JSX. This is the only required method in a
                class component.</li>
            <li>componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component is rendered to the DOM. It is often used
                for tasks like fetching data from an API.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>2.Updating Phase:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): This method is called before rendering when new props or
                state are being received. It allows you to control whether the component should re-render or not.</li>
            <li>render(): Renders the updated component.</li>
            <li>componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): This method is called after the component is updated in the
                DOM.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.Unmounting Phase:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>componentWillUnmount(): This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. It is
                used for cleanup tasks like canceling network requests or clearing up subscriptions.</li>
